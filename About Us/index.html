    <h1>About NARI</h1>
    <p>
        NARI is a groundbreaking initiative focused on creating a safer environment for women across India. Women face numerous challenges daily, from safety concerns to the lack of awareness about their legal rights. With India ranking poorly in women's safety, our web application, NARI, aims to improve the quality of life for women by providing crucial tools, resources, and support systems at their fingertips.
    </p>
    
    <div class="mission">
        <p>Empowering Women, Ensuring Safety, Spreading Awareness</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Our mission is simple yet impactful: to empower women by giving them the information and tools they need to feel safe, informed, and supported. We strive to create a platform where women can access safety features, legal resources, and support networks easily and efficiently, helping them navigate difficult situations in real-time.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Key Features of NARI:</div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SOS (Emergency Alert):</strong> In case of an emergency, users can send their live location to local authorities and trusted contacts. This real-time alert system aims to ensure help reaches women as soon as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Nearby Alerts:</strong> If the app is installed on nearby devices, it can notify users in the vicinity whenever a woman requires urgent assistance, ensuring the community is aware and can act immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Women's Helpline Numbers:</strong> NARI provides a comprehensive list of essential helpline numbers for women, ensuring quick access to assistance when needed.</li>
     
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">Our Vision</div>
    <p>
        At NARI, our vision is to create a safer and more inclusive world where women can move freely without fear. By leveraging technology, we aim to reduce the response time during emergencies, increase awareness of womenâ€™s rights, and promote community involvement in ensuring women's safety. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="section-title">Why NARI?</div>
    <p>
        Women in India often face harassment, domestic violence, and discrimination, both in public and private spheres. Many women remain unaware of their legal rights or how to seek help. NARI serves as a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between women and the resources available to them. By integrating safety features and legal information in a single app, we empower women to take control of their safety and well-being.
